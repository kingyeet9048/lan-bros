## Product Description 

Over the years, entertainment has developed in ways that we cannot even imagine. One form of entertainment is Mario Bros. Since the initial conception, Mario Bros has been enjoyed by many for several years. This game is on many different platforms for both single player and multiplayer. The one platform that is not common is online through a LAN connection. One such instance of a platform like this is the Nintendo Switch. Users can play with another person right next to them. The only question is this: should users have to pay in order to enjoy entertainment. Players need to be able to enjoy a game with another person sitting next to them for free. To solve this problem, we propose a simple client-server executable Mario Bros game like game. This is called LAN Bros.
